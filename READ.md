JSON based CSS preprocessor

Using ES6 classes you can create totally programatic styling.

See sample.js for example.

Syntax for running program (requires babel-node or other es6 commandline tool..... for now): 

babel-node main.js source target

such as 

babel-node main.js ./sample.js sample.css
